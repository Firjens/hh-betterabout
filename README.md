# Better About Command

**Welcome to the "Better About Command" plugin**

This plugin let's you modify the about command, it also adds an image (which cannot be changed right now because I don't want people to abuse this.)


**This command overwrites your about command. You are REQUIRED to correctly credit the emulator owners, developers, etc. Failing to do so can lead into receiving a bad reputation. The only reason why this plugin is here is to make you able to customise it more to your own liking. Do NOT claim the Emulator as your own!!!!**

## Installation:
1) Download the plugin: [https://git.krews.org/Hackerman/better-about-command/blob/master/release/pluginAbout.jar](https://git.krews.org/Hackerman/better-about-command/blob/master/release/pluginAbout.jar) and place it in your "plugins" directory. Restart your emulator.

2) Add the following in your external flash texts:

`notification.about.title=About Arcturus`

`notification.about.message=This hotel is running Arcturus Emulator (Morningstar Edit).<br><br>Thanks for using Arcturus. Report issues on the forums. http://arcturus.pw.<br><br>Created by TheGeneral`
